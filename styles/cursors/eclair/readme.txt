Eclair™
Cursor Pack for Windows




It's my 1st cursor pack deviation for Windows
I'm kinda bored with Aero Cursors so i decided to make mine

.. and share it with you guys ... 

it's the 1st time i made my own cursor pack and so far so good. 
" What's SO great about this ? " 
 Installing is simply as 2 clicks! -- installation is in config file
 Glossy look and Awesome shape to fit any desktop -- very nice design
 Cursors are animated -- isn't that awesome! so it's not boring
 Aqua swirl is in there too -- with a little retouch for a perfect set of cursors
 Busy cursor is not what you think it is -- no it's not just ported from Mac OSX
see it for your self ... there's an extra animation in there that you wouldn't see in your native Mac

More Cursors -- Coming Soon!
